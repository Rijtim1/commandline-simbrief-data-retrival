# Simbrief CommandLine Tool

This little script downloads data from the latest flight plan you created in simbrief and displays the most important data (IMO) to begin a flight.

## **IMPORTANT**

Make sure you have python installed. Also make sure you have the script added to environment variable path for it to be a commandline argument. Doing this will allow you to simply type "simbrief" in your command prompt in order to run the program.

## Future

I do not intend to add a GUI to this project, however if you deem that is a necessity, then feel free to add it.

## Create An issue if there is more information that you would like to add

We can have a discussion there.
